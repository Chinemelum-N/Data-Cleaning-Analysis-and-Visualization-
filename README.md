Overview
This project integrates Power BI, MongoDB, and Python to analyze and visualize data efficiently.
â€¢	MongoDB is used as the database for storing structured and unstructured data.
â€¢	Python serves as the intermediary, handling data processing and transformation.
â€¢	Power BI is used for creating insightful visualizations and reports.
Features
âœ… Data Extraction: Retrieve data from MongoDB using Python.
âœ… Data Processing: Clean, transform, and prepare data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot).
âœ… Visualization: Build dashboards in Power BI to explore trends, patterns, and KPIs.
âœ… Interactivity: Create dynamic reports with filters and drill-down capabilities.
Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ MongoDB Compass â€“ NoSQL database for storing structured and semi-structured data.
ðŸ”¹ Python â€“ Data processing using Pandas and Matplotlib
ðŸ”¹ Power BI â€“ Dashboard and report visualization.
